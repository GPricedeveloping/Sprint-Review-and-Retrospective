How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs and translating them into a program involves effective communication and observation. The initial step is listening to the user's challenges and needs. Creating "user stories" simplifies complex requirements into actionable tasks, ensuring the development of features that genuinely meet user needs and expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaching program development with an iterative and Agile mindset, I prioritize modularity, clean code, and frequent testing. This allows for continuous improvements rather than waiting for a final product. Looking ahead, my goal is to integrate more automated testing and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) into my Agile workflow for a more streamlined and efficient development process.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a valuable team member in software development extends beyond coding; it involves effective collaboration, respecting team members, contributing to code reviews, and taking ownership of both successes and failures. Key to this is communication, ensuring everyone is updated to align objectives and deliver successful projects.
